# FaceVerification-and-FaceRecognition (CNN Part 4)
Welcome to the Happy House! Here you will build a face recognition system, which is the extension of Part 3 of CNN series, The HappyHouse.

#### Face recognition problems commonly fall into two categories:
1. Face Verification : "is this the claimed person?". For example, at some airports, you can pass through customs by letting a system scan your passport and then verifying that you (the person carrying the passport) are the correct person. A mobile phone that unlocks using your face is also using face verification. This is a 1:1 matching problem.

2. Face Recognition :  "who is this person?". For example, the video lecture showed a face recognition video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wr4rx0Spihs) of Baidu employees entering the office without needing to otherwise identify themselves. This is a 1:K matching problem.

### Dependencies:
1. Python 3.6
2. Numpy
3. Keras with tensorflow backend
4. Matplotlib
5. Scipy, OpenCv2
6. Pandas, h5py

### Step by Step Implementation of HappyHouse:
- [x] Install all the latest dependencies.
- [x] Clone the repository in your local system.
- [x] Make sure all folders are in same location
- [x] Open any python3.6 IDE and execute FaceRecognition.py
- [x] Visualize the results.

*If you want to test with you own image, then the replace your picture in images folder
and execute FaceRecognition.py, Hopefully it should work* 
> Note: Make sure the dimension of image is matched with the originally tested one.

**The Repository also has notebook(.ipynb) file, which has detailed explnation of
project and also implmentation steps, do check it out once**
